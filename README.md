#Current Time

##Installation from Github:
1. From GitHub, fork and clone this repo. 
1. I would use the npm init command to create a new package.json 
1. Morgan (for logging to API.log file): https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/morgan.html
1. Super Test (for the test): https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest

##Docker
1. I've included a dockerfile but did not include the necessary dependencies for running the application. The same installation instructions above would apply (minus the fork and clone)

##API.log
1. This file should list the most basic information and can easily be updated to include additional more specific information.
